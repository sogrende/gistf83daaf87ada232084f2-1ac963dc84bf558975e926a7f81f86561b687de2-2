## Howdy!

Welcome, we're so excited to have you here! The purpose of this gist is to get to know you a bit better and understand your communication style when talking with our users. Please read through and let us know at any point if you have any questions!

## Answer the test tickets
Below you'll find several faux support tickets. Names and identifying information have been changed, but otherwise these support requests are pretty faithful. We'vealso written some information that should give you an idea of how we go about answering the questions we get. 

## GitHub support tenets: a tl;dr

### Logic + empathy
It's a satisfying balance to bring both analytical skills to a problem, but also remember to respond to a user with care.

### Transparency + honesty
We put effort into writing up [post-mortem blog posts about What Went Wrong](https://github.com/blog/1397-recent-code-search-outages). The balance here is to show enough transparency so users feel respected, but in the case where things are horribly wrong, not share so much that we overwhelm them. 

[Here's an example of a support request](https://gist.github.com/3e89df1f7c0e7d6d5737). It may be easier to say something vague and not-technically-untrue like "there was a small problem and we fixed it". It means we don't have to cop to a mistake on our end. Our users are in the tech world, and are used to figuring out problems. We have found we're much better off telling them what's up, and why.

### Surprise + delight
We have an awesome user base, who generally think we're pretty great. We've put a lot of social effort into drinkups, conference talks and blog posts that wow people and create fans of our company and the products we [ship](http://shipitsquirrel.github.io/images/ship%20it%20squirrel.png).

We follow the [Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service), and go above and beyond when it's appropriate. We have the ability to refund as much as we want, and to offer coupons as often as we want. We use this judiciously, as you can turn a surprise into disappointment if wielded badly. You can go back to logic+empathy to consider if what you'd like to do will actually delight the user.

Often, our users may just need information quickly and clearly, without being goofy. We have to know how to respond in the way that best matches how the user is feeling.

### GitHub voice

To explain it casually, we try to exude something that sounds like the person:

* is a real human
* is invested in things going well for you (we care)
* is really smart, but kind (not egotistical)
* and maybe kind of funny (good robot test)
* or at least interesting (and also not actually a robot)
* is not businessy
* could be found in a hoodie, blaring music, slouching in a bean bag chair

### Humble brag
Here's what someone wrote about us, [in a longer piece about moving their company to GitHub](http://blog.marmelab.com/switching-our-corporate-version-control-system-to-github):
>This leads me to the Customer Service itself. The GitHub staff I’ve been in contact with is extremely helpful, efficient, and comprehensive of our specific requirements. Most important: you deal with real people with real names, not with an anonymous service. When a member of the support staff takes your case (which happens in minutes, even for us Europeans), you get in touch with this person each time you interact on the case. And their CRM tools seem good enough so that your customer history is quickly available to all the support staff. I must say that I didn’t expect such a good customer service from a company with a reputation of automating everything they can, but they really take customer relationship seriously.

### An FYI on how we work
Most of the support team is remote, so we use a group chat room and a support app to work together. We also use GitHub -- it's where the code is stored, where we log bugs, and where we collaborate on new ideas. We don't tend to email or call each other, though we'll videochat every once in a while to catch up. Mostly we hang out in the support chat room to communicate.

## Support tickets

### Ticket #1: Questions and suggestions!

>Hi GitHubbers!  
> I love GitHub! I was at the drinkup in Oklahoma City, it was awesome meeting Sara and Holman.
>
>OK, so I have a couple of questions/bugs to report:
>
>* Is there any way you could add the ability to upload PDF files to Issues? It's so close to being the perfect workflow for me!
>* The gradient is broken on repo pages in Opera 12.
* It looks like you only take credit cards. Can I pay with Bitcoin? No offense, but I don't trust anyone with my credit card details after seeing companies like Target get hacked.

>jamestk

#### Notes:
We never promise features or changes. We do keep a list of feature requests. GitHub does not support Opera. We don't accept Bitcoin.

### Ticket #1 response:
> Hi JamesTK,
>
> Well shucks, I’m so glad you’re loving GitHub! 
>
>I’m going to start with the not-so-awesome news first, and move into the good stuff.  GitHub doesn’t actually support Opera right now,  so that explains why you’re experiencing issues with it. The good news, is that our development team is really committed to making sure GitHubbers can achieve that “perfect workflow”, so they keep track of suggestions like this to be sure they’re building features that are really useful to users like you.  I’m going to pass on your suggestion to be able to upload PDFs into Issues, and that being able to use Opera is important to you. Thanks for the feedback!
>
>Unfortunately GitHub does not accept Bitcoin as a payment option, but you do have the option to pay with Paypal.  If you’re worried about the security of your credit card information, this may be a good option for you.  Just let me know if you want to make the switch to Paypal, I’d be happy to walk you through changing your payment method.
>
>Please let me know if you have any other questions, or concerns I can help you out with. Have a great day!
>
>Thanks,

### Ticket #2: Need to get my account back 


> Hi, my name is Jorge,  
>  
> I'm the CTO of JorgeLLC. Last year, an now ex colleague, Fabian Freebird registered a github organization in name of our company. Mr Freebird has left the company in December 2012 and disappeared. The the github organization is still registered on his account. So i would like to ask if you could transfer the organization to my account jorge2010.
>
>With kind regards,  
>Jorge

#### Notes:

* Looking at our admin view, JorgeLLC is an organization account with one owner -- freebird72
* Looking at the security history of the organization, the user jorge2010 was never a member
* Furthermore, the organization has never had another owner

GitHub does not change ownership of an account (nor will we transfer code) without a court order. This is for security reasons, to protect a legitimate owner from someone scamming their way into becoming the account owner. Also, it protects us from getting in the middle of a fight that we can't settle. We generally suggest two parties work it out themselves, since this results in faster resolution than going to court.

### Ticket #2 response:

> Hi Jorge,
>
>I’m so sorry for this frustration.  I’m going to help you out in every way I can, but unfortunately GitHub can’t change the ownership on accounts without a court order.  It is usually best for you to track down Mr. Freebird and have him change the ownership.  I understand that may be difficult in this situation, so if you need to go to court, and you can provide us with a court order to change the account, we will be able to do so.
>
> If you are able to get everything settled, please let me know and I’ll send along a coupon to help with the first couple months of this transition for your company. 
>
> I wish you the best of luck, please let me know if there is anything else I can help with!
>
>Thanks,
>
>Sophia



### Ticket #3: Unhappy about forking

>JamesTK here, I have another question.

>One of my dev collaborator forked my private repo without explicit permission to do so... is that typical? I am surprised that the system did not notify me if it was okay to grant the fork permission. Is there a way to setup permissions of this sort? Also, other than asking the collaborator to delete the forked repo, can I actually delete it?

>Thanks, jamestk

#### Notes:
*You've checked the account in our admin view, he only has one personal repository (jamestk/tribbles), which has one collaborator. Any documentation you may need is available on [help.github.com](https://help.github.com).*

### Ticket #3 response:

>Hi JamesTK,
>
>Thanks for checking in! It looks like your personal repository does have one collaborator listed, so this person would be allowed to fork this repository. If you would prefer that no one has the ability to fork this repository I recommend creating a new repository with no collaborators, or removing the collaborator from your current private repository. Wow, how many times can I use ‘repository’ in a sentence? 
>
>As your project grows you may want to consider moving from a user account to an organization account.  This would allow you to place collaborators on specific teams based on how much access you would like them to have to each repository. 
>
>Since this is a private repository, you have the ability to delete the entire repository (which will delete all its forks), but not the ability to delete just one fork. Fortunately, that’s something I can do! So, if you let me know which fork you would like deleted I will be happy to take care of it.
>
>If you have any questions on the options I mentioned, or need help implementing changes to your account please let me know!
>
>Thanks,
>
>Sophia
